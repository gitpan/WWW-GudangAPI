SYNOPSIS
     use WWW::GudangAPI qw(get_ga_ssuri);
     my $uri = get_ga_ssuri(
         module => 'tax/id/npwp',
         sub    => 'parse_npwp',
         #https => 1, # use https, default is 0
     );
     my $res = $uri->call(npwp=>'00.000.001.8-000');
     say "valid!" if $res->[0] == 200; # prints 'valid!'

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the Perl client library for GudangAPI,
    <http://www.gudangapi.com/>. It is currently a very thin wrapper for
    Sub::Spec::URI, since GudangAPI is Sub::Spec::HTTP-compliant. As a
    matter of fact, you can just do:

     my $uri = Sub::Spec::URI->new("http://gudangapi.com/ga/MODULE::FUNC");
     my $res = $uri->call(ARG=>..., ...);

    and skip this module altogether. But in the future some convenience
    features will be added to this module.

    This module uses Log::Any.

    This module's functions has Sub::Spec specs.

FUNCTIONS
    None are exported, but they are exportable.

  get_ga_ssuri(%args) -> [STATUS_CODE, ERR_MSG, RESULT]
    Create Sub::Spec::URI object to access GudangAPI.com API functions.

    Once a Sub::Spec::URI object is created, you can call function, get
    function spec, etc. See Sub::Spec::URI documentation for more details.

    Returns a 3-element arrayref. STATUS_CODE is 200 on success, or an error
    code between 3xx-5xx (just like in HTTP). ERR_MSG is a string containing
    error message, RESULT is the actual result.

    Arguments ("*" denotes required arguments):

    *   module* => *str*

        Name of module to call.

    *   sub => *str*

        Name of function to call.

    *   https => *bool* (default 0)

        Whether to use HTTPS instead of HTTP.

        You might want to use HTTPS if you send sensitive data such as
        password or financial data. Note that HTTPS access has higher
        latency.

    *   user => *str* (default "ga")

        GudangAPI username.
