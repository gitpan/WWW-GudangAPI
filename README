SYNOPSIS
     use WWW::GudangAPI qw(call_ga);
     my $uri = call_ga(
         module => 'tax/id/npwp',
         func   => 'parse_npwp',
         #https => 1, # use https, default is 0
         args => {npwp=>'00.000.001.8-000'}
     );
     my $res = $uri->call(npwp=>'00.000.001.8-000');
     say "valid!" if $res->[0] == 200; # prints 'valid!'

DESCRIPTION
    This module is the Perl client library for GudangAPI,
    <http://www.gudangapi.com/>. It is currently a very thin (and probably
    pretty useless) wrapper for Perinci::Access, since GudangAPI is
    Riap-compliant. As a matter of fact, you can just do:

     my $pa = Perinci::Access->new;
     my $res = $pa->request(call => "http://gudangapi.com/ga/MODULE::FUNC",
                            {args=>{ARG=>...}});

    and skip this module altogether. But in the future some convenience
    features will be added to this module.

    This module uses Log::Any.

    This module has Rinci metadata.
